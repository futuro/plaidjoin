THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL IN ALPHA, I MAKE NO GUARANTEES ABOUT ITS CORRECTNESS

Dependencies:
    ksetpass                       : From kadmin-remctl project
    ldap{add,search,delete,modify} : From ldap-utils
    kinit/kdestroy/ktutil          : From krb5-user
    rm                             : Standard rm command
    ifconfig                       : net-tools (on linux, not sure about elsewhere)

    Linux Specific:
        lsmod

    Solaris Specific:
        encrypt, svcs, svcadm

NOTE:
    This is still in the alpha stage. Use at your own risk.

Acknowledgements:
    This would have been vastly more difficult without the tangential
    assistance of Nico Williams and Baban Kenkre, through their work on
    adjoin.sh.
