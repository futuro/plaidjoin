Incorporate the 'dnssrv' option into dns queries
    '--dnssrv', and it's variable '$dnssrv', aren't used in /every/ DNS query. This seems wrong,
    and should probably be fixed so that every DNS query will look at '$dnssrv'. I don't know
    exactly how I want to do that at the moment...

Figure out what to do with '$site'.
    It's never used in adjoin.sh, so I'm not really
    certain what it's intended purpose was, but perhaps it was supposed to be used with the
    'getSite()' function. I assume I'll know more once I get down to that part of the file,
    but it's somewhat vexing to deal with.

Decide what things should count as error states, and how to handle them.
    There isn't a lot of thought put into what to do when various things fail, and that
    definitely needs to be taken into account.
